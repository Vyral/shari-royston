Regardless of how tidy you are, your floors, rugs, and carpets get dirty. Between the dirt you track in on your shoes, the accidental spills, and the inevitable accumulation of dust, your floors can get quite grimy. Here are a few cleaning tips and tricks for all types of flooring.

**Natural Stone Floors&nbsp;**One of the most important rules when it comes to cleaning natural stone, is to steer clear of acidic products like vinegar, ammonia, or bleach, as they can ruin the stone. Your best bet is to use a pH-neutral cleaner that won’t react with the minerals in your stone floor.

**Tile Floors&nbsp;**Tile is easy to clean. Simply combine ¼ cup of vinegar and one drop of dish soap in a spray bottle. Fill the rest with water and mix well. Spritz the mixture onto your tile surface and wipe it down with a microfiber cloth or mop. Steaming the tiles and grout will provide a deep cleaning.

**Carpets&nbsp;**Unlike other flooring surfaces, carpets have their own set of rules. For a deep clean, it’s best to&nbsp;[steam clean your carpets](https://www.wikihow.com/Steam-Clean-Carpet). For regular cleaning, using a vacuum should suffice.

**Hardwood Floors&nbsp;**[Wood floors](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/how-to-clean-wood-floors)&nbsp;need a lot of attention. Start by determining whether your floor is sealed or not. If it’s unsealed, avoid using water and instead try&nbsp;[mineral oil and periodic coats of wax](https://www.hunker.com/12001027/how-to-clean-unsealed-wood-floors). If the floor is sealed, a simple mix of hot water and soap is a safe bet.

**Linoleum&nbsp;**Start by sweeping or vacuuming the floor to get rid of dust, hair, and dirt. Then add about six drops of mild detergent or dish soap to a gallon of warm or hot water. Dampen a mop with the mixture and use it to clean the floor in sections. Avoid getting the mop too wet, and make sure to dry the floors with a towel when you’re done. Standing water can damage linoleum.

Looking to liven up your bathroom? Better set aside some big bucks. According to&nbsp;[HomeAdvisor](https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/bathrooms/remodel-a-bathroom/), “The average bathroom remodel costs $10,354.” Don’t panic, you can still get a fresh, new look at a fraction of the cost, with these money-saving tips and tricks.

**Keep the same layout&nbsp;**You might want to chuck it all and start over with a completely new layout, but the cost of moving water lines could push your budget into no-man’s land. According to HGTV’s&nbsp;[Scott McGillivray](https://www.hgtv.ca/scott-mcgillivray/photos/scott-mcgillivrays-inexpensive-bathroom-remodel-ideas-1927622/), “Moving the tub, vanity, or toilet will cost about $2,500 each.”<br><br>**Do your own tilework**Is the DIY spirit calling to you? Tiling your own bathroom floor and shower can be satisfying—and money-saving. Be sure to&nbsp;[watch a tutorial](https://www.lowes.com/n/how-to/install-floor-tile)&nbsp;or two first. It’s also a good idea to practice your technique on a piece of MDF with inexpensive tile before jumping in.

If you are springing for professional installation, keep in mind that large-scale tile will provide savings.

**Go garage sale-ing&nbsp;**Yes, you can find some great accessories at garage sales, Craigslist or Nextdoor, but keep your eye out for larger pieces, too. An old dresser can easily be turned into a vanity. Not only will this save you money, it will also bring character into the space.

**Resurface&nbsp;**“An old tub or shower will surely show signs of aging eventually, but before you swap things out for new, which can cost a pretty penny, consider resurfacing,” said&nbsp;[Family Handyman](https://www.familyhandyman.com/bathroom/10-ways-to-save-money-during-your-bathroom-renovation/). “Your tub or shower can be professionally resurfaced for much cheaper than buying new.”

**Look for leftovers&nbsp;**Stone yards, tile shops, contractors—they may all have leftovers you can purchase or even have. That countertop remnant could work perfectly on top of that vanity you have your eye on, and save you enough money to buy it\!

Water damage is one of a homeowner’s greatest worries since it can result in mold and expensive repairs. The following tips can help you prevent potential sources of seepage in your home.

**Don’t plant next to your house.&nbsp;**A flower or shrub border is lovely, and some folks like thorny bushes beneath their windows as a deterrent to break-ins, but watering those plants could damage your foundation. It’s wiser to keep your flower beds a few feet away from the house or make sure they slope away from it.

**Use gutters and downspouts to divert rain runoff away from your foundation.&nbsp;**If you notice water pooling after a rain, that area needs gutters. Also, make sure you have sufficient gutters for your entire roof. Extend downspouts away from the house and, if possible, discharge underground with PVC pipe to drain into the street.

**Check your roof regularly for loose shingles – especially after high wind or rainstorms.&nbsp;**Inspect metal flashing for damage and make sure skylights are properly sealed. Check your attic for wet spots or any signs of mold, condensation, damage to insulation, or a rodent or insect infestation that could lead to weak areas and subsequent leaks.
